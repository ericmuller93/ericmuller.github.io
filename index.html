							<p>An experienced Business Analyst and Software Developer in Seattle Washington.
									My true passion is combining the business and technology to achieve a goal. 
									I am always on the hunt for new opportunities to further challenge myself in both areas.
									My ultimate goal is to be a technical analyst that can be a skilled liaison between
									technical and software teams. Using data to solve problems has always interested me
									and I am looking forward to working with it!
									<br><br>
									Recently, I moved from New York City to Seattle Washington. Luckily, I still feel at home 
									because Seattle has plenty of my favorite things, which are food and coffee. Personally,
									I enjoy traveling, exploring new places and cultures, and of course trying new food! 
									On top of that I am an avid heavy metal enthusiast, so you'll see me at every concert!
									<br><br>
									Thanks for checking out my website! Read more about my professional experience below.

			<!-- Business Analyst Experience -->
			<h2>My Experience in Business Analysis!</h2>
			<div class="expText">
				<p>My diverse business analyst experience was built for over three years in the 
					finance industry. I excel at gathering requirements for projects I was managing
					 and collecting data from various sources to support my recommendations. 
					 My main responibilities required me to support the users of a software which 
					 included trainings, creating documentation, and managing updates.</p>
			 </div>
			<!-- end business analyst experience -->

			<!-- Python Experience -->
			<h2>My Experience in Python!</h2>
			<div class="expText">
					I have built a few applications in python, mainly using pycharm. You can find them on 
					<a href="https://github.com/ericmuller93/Python-Projects">my Github.</a>
					<br>
					The first is an application that will let you select two directories and move files of a specific 
					extension from the first to the second. It then stores what file you moved and the last time it was 
					edited in a SQLite 3 database. I created the GUI using tkinter.
					<br> 
					Another is a fictional website for a hotel with a food ordering system. I utilized 
					Django to create this.There is an admin function to create, update and delete 
					food items from the menu.
					<br>
					Last and certainly not least, I worked with a SCRUM team to develop a web scraper in
					Django. We used modules like BeautifulSoup and Selenium to pull data from various websites
					and have this data in one central place. The user could then see a personalized feed of 
					the weather, upcoming events, and applicable news story on their site.
				</div>
			
			<!-- end python experience -->

			<!-- C# Experience -->
			<h2>My Experience in C#!</h2>
				<div class="expText">
					C# was an exciting language to learn. I very much enjoyed working with MVC in Visual Studio
					to make dynamic websites. You can find a car insurance quote generator on 
					<a href="https://github.com/ericmuller93/C-Sharp-Projects">my Github.</a>
					This project really helped me utilize the power of MVC. When a user enters all of their information,
					the system will calculate their quote and direct them to a details page. On the back end all of this 
					information is stored in a SQL server database. An admin view was created for a site owner to maintain
					all of the entries.
					<br>
					In addition to MVC I made many console applications. One of my favorites is a TwentyOne or
					BlackJack game. A user specifies how much money they brought and proceeds to play and bet until
					they run out. This application helped me build a very solid understanding of not only C# but Object
					Oriented Programming too. I feel it's very important to understand concepts like inheritance and
					exception handling to make a proper program.
				</div>
			
			<!-- end C# experience -->

			<!-- Front-End Experience -->
			<h2>My Experience in Front End Development!</h2>
				<div class="expText">
					Throught my coding experience I have always used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build the Front-End
					portion of many projects. For example this very webpage you are viewing is built with the mentioned
					tools and bootstrap!
					<br>
					One of my more challenging Javascript heavy projects was building a pizza ordering website. On this
					page the user could select from many various options to customize their pizza order. When the user
					submits their order, the page would return an itemized receipt of what they ordered and a cost breakdown.
					<br>
					Additionally I was always referring back to my Front-End languages when working in Python and C#. 
					When using MVC and Django I was constantly creating and styling my pages of web applications. I always
					found this to be a fun mix of technologies!
